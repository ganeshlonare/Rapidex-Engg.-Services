- **URL**: https://www.rapidex.tech

## ðŸš¨ If You Still Don't See Metadata

### Common Issues & Solutions:

1. **Old Cache**: Use "Scrape Again" or "Refresh" buttons in debuggers
2. **Testing with localhost**: Make sure you're testing with `https://www.rapidex.tech`, not localhost
3. **Browser Cache**: Try testing in incognito/private mode
4. **Platform Delays**: Some platforms take 5-10 minutes to update

### Debugging Commands:

```bash
# Check if your site is accessible
curl -I https://www.rapidex.tech

# Check if your image is accessible  
curl -I https://www.rapidex.tech/assets/images/rapidex-social-share.png

# Check your environment variables
npm run check-env
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Conclusion

**Your metadata implementation is perfect!** The issue you were experiencing was likely due to:
- Testing with localhost URLs (which social media can't access)
- Social media platform caching
- Not using the debugging tools to refresh the cache

Your website will now show rich previews with title, description, and image when shared on all major social media platforms.
